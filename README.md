# DayPlanner
Day planner application made during coding bootcamp 
Used different bootsrap link for stylesheet, was testing my understanding of bootstrap due to be distracted by my child in class. He's 6 and extremely interested in mommy's classes. So much so that he now has a coding app on his iPad.
 Somehow made my save buttons smaller. 
tried to text align center my header,,,,,it sort of worked? I am not a css person and will not be quitting my day job for a career in web design, that is certain. Still trying to figure out how to screen shot my deployed web page.

hopefully one of  these works 


This is an application monotonously built by hour function to serve as a day planner throughout a 9-5 work day. The current time and date is displayed under the header. The current hour is in red. Past event are in grey and future events are in green.
